# Setting Up New Git Repository and Development Branch for 'new-project'

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on setting up a new GitHub repository for 'new-project' and creating a development branch to work on new features without affecting the main branch.

## Steps

### 1. Create New GitHub Repository
- Go to github (https://github.com/) and log in to your account.
- Click on the '+' icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository".
- Enter the repository name as 'new-project'.
- Optionally, add a description and choose other repository settings.
- Click "Create repository".

### 2. Clone the Repository Locally
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
- Run the following command to clone the repository:  git clone <repository_url>

Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of your newly created GitHub repository.

### 3. Create Development Branch
- Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project directory using the terminal.
- Run the following command to create a new development branch: git checkout -b development

### 4. Make Changes and Commit
- Start working on your new features or changes within the 'development' branch.
- After making changes, add them to the staging area using: git add .

- Commit the changes with an appropriate commit message: git commit -m "Description of changes made"


### 5. Merge Changes into Main Branch
- Once your changes are complete and tested in the 'development' branch, you can merge them into the 'main' branch.
- Switch to the 'main' branch using: git checkout main

- Merge changes from 'development' branch into 'main': git merge development


### 6. Push Changes to GitHub
- Finally, push your changes to the GitHub repository: git push origin main
